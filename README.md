# 🏠 Settlr: AI-Powered Lifestyle Property Search

> 🚀 **AI-powered conversational search** that enhances property platforms by adding lifestyle-based filtering on top of traditional bedroom/price filters, letting users refine results with preferences like *"vibrant area with good coffee and 20-minute commute to Bank for young professionals"*.

---

## 🎯 **Objective**

Current property search platforms like **Zoopla** and **Rightmove** rely on basic filters (💰 price, 🛏️ bedrooms, 📍 location) that don't capture how people actually want to live - forcing users to manually research dozens of neighborhoods to find areas that match their lifestyle, commute needs, and personal preferences, making property search a **frustrating and time-consuming process**.

---

## 💡 **Solution Overview**

We built an **AI-powered conversational search layer** that enhances existing property platforms by allowing users to describe their ideal lifestyle in natural language. Instead of just filtering by *"2 bedrooms under £2000,"* users can say:

> *"vibrant area with good coffee and 20-minute commute to Bank for young professionals"* ☕✨

Our AI analyzes neighborhood data including:
- 🚇 Transport times
- 🏪 Amenity density  
- 👥 Demographics
- 🌆 Local characteristics

To surface properties that truly match their **lifestyle requirements** alongside traditional search criteria.

## 🎯 **Target Audience**

**B2B2C model** targeting users of major property platforms:
- 🇬🇧 **Rightmove, Zoopla**
- 🇺🇸 **Zillow**

Through **exclusive partnerships** with one dominant aggregator per market. Since these platforms compete fiercely with each other, we aim to give one player in each city a significant competitive advantage through our AI lifestyle search capability, creating **defensible market positioning** while reaching millions of property searchers through their existing user base. 🚀

## 🌍 **Future Potential**

Scale through **sequential market expansion** starting with one exclusive UK aggregator partner, then replicate the model in major rental-stressed megapolises:

🏙️ **Target Cities:**
- 🗽 New York
- 🌉 San Francisco  
- 🗼 Paris
- 🚲 Amsterdam

Securing **one dominant platform partnership per city**. This creates a global network of AI-enhanced property search while maintaining competitive exclusivity in each market, potentially reaching **millions of renters** across the world's most challenging housing markets where lifestyle-location matching delivers the highest value. 📈

## 🔧 **Challenges Faced**

🚧 **API Access Issues:** Major property aggregators either don't provide public APIs or recently restricted access, requiring formal partnerships for data integration.

✅ **Our Solution:** We developed a sophisticated data generation solution powered by high-intelligence search algorithms to create realistic property datasets for demonstration purposes.

🗺️ **Mapping Complexity:** Accurately mapping London's complex neighborhood boundaries and displaying them interactively proved technically challenging.

✅ **Our Solution:** We created a unified integration between MapTiler's boundary data and Anthropic's AI model to intelligently parse and visualize geographic regions with precise neighborhood-level granularity.
